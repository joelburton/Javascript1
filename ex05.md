Exercise 05 - Final Test
================================

Time for your final test! The JavaScript guys are really laying it on thick now. They want you to write your own JavaScript from scratch and what's more is they don't want you to modify ANY of the current HTML or CSS to complete the tasks.

Included in this test is the [final.html](https://github.com/hackbrightacademy/Javascript1/blob/master/final.html) page. Open the file up to edit and follow the instructions given in the comments.

This test uses event handlers and all the bells and whistles.

Happy coding!
