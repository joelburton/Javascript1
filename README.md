Introduction to Javascript

###Python-To-Javascript Dictionary###

Some reference material to help you compare Python and JavaScript.

### Running your code

You can work on these exercises in one of two different ways:

#### In an HTML Page

You can create a basic HTML page with a Javascript section, and do your coding in there.
This could look like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Javascript Learning</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Javascript Learning</h1>
  <script>
    // Code goes here
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

(If you do this, you'll need to show the Javascript console to see what you print to it—you
can do that in Chrome with the `View`/`Developer` menu.)

#### In an online Javascript editor/runner

You can do your coding and testing using http://repl.it/languages/JavaScript.
