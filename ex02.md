Exercise 02 - Translation
=========================

Another translation exercise brought to you by the letter Σ and the
number 0.5772156649

Well your last assignment went well—the Javascript team was pleased and
we're feeling optimistic. Now to bring our peoples together by pointing
out possible stylistic similarities that would strengthen the bonds between teams.

The Python code below uses a function, `filter()`, that is built in to Python,
but that you may not have seen. The signature for it is:

```python
   def filter(function, a_list):
       """Filter a list to those items that return true for the given function.

       For each item in `a_list`, call the function `a_function` on it. Return
       a new list of only those items for which `a_function` returns True.

       For example, if you had a function, `is_even` that returns True for even
       numbers as False for odd numbers, `filter(is_even, [1, 2, 3, 4]) would
       return `[2, 4]`.
       """
```

(You've learned you could also do this with a list comprehension, but the
`filter()` function can be another nice, succinct way to filter a list down to
a new list)

Do your best at this new assignment—this Python code exhibits a style that might
remind the Javascriptians they have more in common than they think.
(Hint the answer is [functions](https://github.com/hackbrightacademy/Javascript1/blob/master/function.md))

Your translation won't be line-for-line this time around. Javascript doesn't have
a built in `filter` function or a built in `sum` function. You'll have to write your own.

The entire thing can be accomplished with for-loops, but I think the Javascript team
would really appreciate seeing you write the filter and sum functions that their people lack.

(Note: new browsers use a version of Javascript that does, in fact, have a `filter` *method*
 on arrays that works similarly to Python's
filter, but, sadly, you can't yet count on Javascriptians using these newer browsers,
so you'll have to write your own `filter` function.)

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```python

def fibonacci_set(max):
    """Return list of fibonacci numbers going up to but not beyond max."""
	if max > 1:
		fib_list = [1]
		current_fib = 1
		while current_fib < max:
			fib_list.append(current_fib)
			current_fib = fib_list[-1] + fib_list[-2]
		return fib_list
	else:
		return [1, 1]

def is_even(n):
    """Is number even?"""
    return n % 2 == 0

print sum(filter(is_even, fibonacci_set(4000000)))

```
